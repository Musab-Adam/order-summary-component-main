### What I learned

I learn working with card and image.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

I want to keep focusing on responsive design, as i encounter some issues with some styles i wiil keep practice to improve my skills.
